            <h1>About Our College</h1>
            <p>
                The College was founded on 20th June 1946 by the People's Education Society of which the Late Bharat-Ratna Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (An Architect of Indian Constitution) M.A., Ph.D., D.Sc. (London), LL.D. (Columbia), D.Lit. (Osmania) Barat-Law, was the Chairman.

            <p>
                The establishment of this college opened a new chapter in the history of higher education in the State of Maharashtra, for the object of the Society in starting the institution was to cater to the educational needs of the ever-growing populations of this cosmopolitan city in general and to promote higher education among the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in particular.
